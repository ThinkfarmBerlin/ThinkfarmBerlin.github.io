We cooperate with civil society partners in Berlin and internationally
to offer youth participation projects, [residencies for emerging
artists](https://lernlabor.berlin/parallel-residency/), outdoor
education and local activities that foster (inter)cultural cooperation
and understanding.

We are accredited in the field of Youth by Jugend für Europa, the German
National Agency of the Erasmus+ programme, and our activities are open
to people of diverse backgrounds, free of charge.

We offer a platform for educators, activists, artists and volunteers to
develop their civil society engagement and co-create educational and
cultural initiatives.  We currently run an Open Choir that meets every
week in the Thinkfarm.
