Hugo based Thinkfarm.org homepage.

# Build and deploy

This website is based on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static side generator.
The command `hugo` will build the complete website to `public/`. You can then
copy the contents of that folder to your server.

For local development you can also run `hugo server` to start a local test
server on port 1313.

# Edit content

-   All website content resides in the `content/` folder in markdown/TOML format.
    ([Hugo documentation on content management](https://gohugo.io/content-management/))
-   Static files (e.g. images) are in `static/`.
-   HTML templates are in `layouts/`.
